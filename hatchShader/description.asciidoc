== Hatch Effect Shader

This shader was ported by http://unlekker.net/[Marius Watz] from http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/[Meshlab]. 

Currently, the vertex shader fails to successfully calculate the normal between the light and each vertex which makes the light appear to move around as the spheres spin. This is a bug.
